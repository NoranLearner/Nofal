Store API Application

_You have a store app (with Laravel). The app divides the products by different categories._

Create an API. For each of the following features:
1. Retrieve the most 5 categories that contain products.
2. Retrieve the high price 5 products for a specific category.
3. Create a new product.
4. Update the image of a specific product.
5. Delete all expired products.
6. Show every hour a message with products that became 5 and less in our store.

**Note:**
_each category has one image, and each product has two pictures or more._
